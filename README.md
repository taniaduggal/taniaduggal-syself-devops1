A front-end web app in Python which lets you vote between two options


A Redis which collects new votes


A .NET worker which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦


A Postgres database backed by a Docker volume


A Node.js web app which shows the results of the voting in real time

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster 1.16+
- Helm 3.0+
- Ingress controller (e.g., NGINX Ingress Controller)


## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/taniaduggal/taniaduggal-syself-devops1.git
```

2. Install the chart

```
helm install <release-name> <path-of helm-files> -n voting-app --create-namespace (helm install helm-release . -n voting-app --create-namespace)
helm list (to check helm all releases)
```

## Accessing the Application

After deploying the chart, you can access the application at: http://<ingress-host>: NodePort


Replace <ingress-host> with the value specified in your ingress.host.


## Why I go for Helm Charts?

Templating: Enables dynamic configuration and reusability across environments.


Package management: Bundles related Kubernetes resources into a single unit


Versioning: Facilitates easier rollbacks and upgrades of applications.

Dependency management: Allows defining and managing dependencies between charts.

Simplified deployment: Reduces complexity by abstracting Kubernetes manifest details.

Consistency: Ensures uniform deployments across different clusters and environments.

Parameterization: Allows easy customization without modifying core templates.

Release management: Provides tools for tracking and managing deployed releases.
